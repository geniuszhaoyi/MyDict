Questions  to  are based on the following reading passage 
Immediately relevant to game theory are the sex
ratios in certain parasitic wasp species that have a
large excess of females  In these species  fertilized eggs
Line develop into females and unfertilized eggs into males 

A female stores sperm and can determine the sex of
each egg she lays by fertilizing it or leaving it
unfertilized  By Fisher s genetic argument that the sex
ratio will be favored which maximizes the number of
descendants an individual will have and hence the
 number of gene copies transmitted  it should pay a
female to produce equal numbers of sons and daughters 
Hamilton  noting that the eggs develop within their
host the larva of another insect and that the newly
emerged adult wasps mate immediately and disperse 
 offered a remarkably cogent analysis  Since only one
female usually lays eggs in a given larva  it would pay
her to produce one male only  because this one male
could fertilize all his sisters on emergence  Like Fisher 
Hamilton looked for an evolutionarily stable strategy 
 but he went a step further in recognizing that he was
looking for a strategy 
  The author suggests that the work of Fisher and
Hamilton was similar in that both scientists
 conducted their research at approximately
the same time
 sought to manipulate the sex ratios of some
of the animals they studied
 sought an explanation of why certain sex
ratios exist and remain stable

groundwork for the later development of strategy

  The passage contains information that would
answer which of the following questions about
wasps 
A How many eggs does the female wasp

usually lay in a single host larva 
B
 Can some species of wasp determine sex
ratios among their offspring 
C What is the approximate sex ratio

among the offspring of parasitic wasps 
  Which of the following is NOT true of the species of
parasitic wasps discussed in the passage 
 Adult female wasps are capable of storing sperm 
 Female wasps lay their eggs in the larvae of
other insects 
 The adult female wasp can be fertilized by a male that
was hatched in the same larva as herself 
 So few male wasps are produced that extinction is
almost certain 
 Male wasps do not emerge from their hosts until they
reach sexual maturity

Extraordinary creative activity has been characterized
as revolutionary  flying in the face of what is established
and producing not what is acceptable but what will
Line become accepted  According to this formulation  highly

creative activity transcends the limits of an existing form
and establishes a new principle of organization  How 
ever  the idea that extraordinary creativity transcends
established limits in misleading when it is applied to the
arts  even though it may be valid for the sciences 
 Difference between highly creative art and highly creative
science arise in part from a difference in their goals  For
the sciences  a new theory is the goal and end result of the
creative act  Innovative science produces new
propositions in terms of which diverse phenomena can be
 related to one another in more coherent ways  Such
phenomena as a brilliant diamond or a nesting bird are
relegated to the role of data  serving as the means for
formulating or testing a new theory  The goal of highly
creative art is very different  the phenomenon itself
 becomes the direct product of the creative act 
Shakespeare s Hamlet is not a tract about the behavior of
indecisive princes or the uses of political power  nor is
Picasso s painting Guernica primarily a propositional
statement about the Spanish Civil War or the evils of
 fascism  What highly creative artistic activity produces is
not a new generalization that transcends established limits 
but rather an aesthetic particular  Aesthetic particulars
produced by the highly creative artist extend or
exploit  in an innovative way  the limits of an existing
 form  rather than transcend that form 
This is not to deny that a highly creative artist some 
times establishes a new principle of organization in the
history of an artistic field  the composer Monteverdi 
who created music of the highest aesthetic value  comes
 to mind  More generally  however  whether or not a
composition establishes a new principle in the history of
music has little bearing on its aesthetic worth  Because
they embody a new principle of organization  some
musical works  such as the operas of the Florentine
 Camerata  are of signal historical importance  but few
listeners or musicologists would include these among the
great works of music  On the other hand  Mozart s The

music even though its modest innovations are confined

The evolution of intelligence among early large
mammals of the grasslands was due in great measure to
the interaction between two ecologically synchronized
Line groups of these animals  the hunting carnivores and the

herbivores that they hunted  The interaction resulting
from the differences between predator and prey led to a
general improvement in brain functions  however  certain
components of intelligence were improved far more than
others 

The kind of intelligence favored by the interplay of
increasingly smarter catchers and increasingly keener
escapers is defined by attention that aspect of mind
carrying consciousness forward from one moment to the
next  It ranges from a passive  free floating awareness to
 a highly focused  active fixation  The range through these
states is mediated by the arousal system  a network of
tracts converging from sensory systems to integrating
centers in the brain stem  From the more relaxed to the
more vigorous levels  sensitivity to novelty is increased 
 The organism is more awake  more vigilant  this
increased vigilance results in the apprehension of ever
more subtle signals as the organism becomes more
sensitive to its surroundings  The processes of arousal and
concentration give attention its direction  Arousal is at
 first general  with a flooding of impulses in the brain stem 
then gradually the activation is channeled  Thus begins
concentration  the holding of consistent images  One
meaning of intelligence is the way in which these images
and other alertly searched information are used in the
 context of previous experience  Consciousness links past
attention to the present and permits the integration of
details with perceived ends and purposes 
The elements of intelligence and consciousness come
together marvelously to produce different styles in
 predator and prey  Herbivores and carnivores develop
different kinds of attention related to escaping or chasing 
Although in both kinds of animal  arousal stimulates the
production of adrenaline and norepinephrine by the
adrenal glands  the effect in herbivores is primarily fear 
 whereas in carnivores the effect is primarily aggression 
For both  arousal attunes the animal to what is ahead 
Perhaps it does not experience forethought as we know it 
but the animal does experience something like it  The
predator is searchingly aggressive  inner directed  tuned
 by the nervous system and the adrenal hormones  but
aware in a sense closer to human consciousness than  say 
a hungry lizard s instinctive snap at a passing beetle 
Using past events as a framework  the large mammal
predator is working out a relationship between
 movement and food  sensitive to possibilities in cold
trails and distant sounds and yesterday s unforgotten
lessons  The herbivore prey is of a different mind  Its
mood of wariness rather than searching and its attitude
of general expectancy instead of anticipating are

In Hardy s novels  various impulses were sacrificed to
each other inevitably and often  Inevitably  because Hardy
did not care in the way that novelists such as
Line Flaubert or James cared  and therefore took paths of least

resistance  Thus  one impulse often surrendered to a
fresher one and  unfortunately  instead of exacting a
compromise  simply disappeared  A desire to throw over
reality a light that never was might give way abruptly to
the desire on the part of what we might consider a
 novelist scientist to record exactly and concretely the
structure and texture of a flower  In this instance  the new
impulse was at least an energetic one  and thus its
indulgence did not result in a relaxed style  But on other
occasions Hardy abandoned a perilous  risky  and highly

critics than has Hardy

Roger Rosenblatt s book Black Fiction  in attempting
to apply literary rather than sociopolitical criteria to its
subject  successfully alters the approach taken by
Line most previous studies  As Rosenblatt notes  criticism

of Black writing has often served as a pretext for
expounding on Black history  Addison Gayle s recent
work  for example  judges the value of Black fiction by
overtly political standards  rating each work according to
the notions of Black identity which it propounds 

Although fiction assuredly springs from political
circumstances  its authors react to those circumstances in
ways other than ideological  and talking about novels and
stories primarily as instruments of ideology circumvents
much of the fictional enterprise  Rosenblatt s literary
 analysis discloses affinities and connections among works
of Black fiction which solely political studies have
overlooked or ignored  Writing acceptable criticism of
Black fiction  however  presupposes giving satisfactory
answers to a number of questions  First of all  is there a
 sufficient reason  other than the racial identity of the
authors  to group together works by Black authors 
Second  how does Black fiction make itself distinct from
other modern fiction with which it is largely
contemporaneous  Rosenblatt shows that Black fiction
 constitutes a distinct body of writing that has an
identifiable  coherent literary tradition  Looking at novels
written by Blacks over the last eighty years  he discovers
recurring concerns and designs independent of
chronology  These structures are thematic  and they
 spring  not surprisingly  from the central fact that the
Black characters in these novels exist in a predominantly
White culture  whether they try to conform to that culture
of rebel against it 
Black Fiction does leave some aesthetic questions
 open  Rosenblatt s thematic analysis permits considerable
objectivity  he even explicitly states that it is not his
intention to judge the merit of the various works yet his
reluctance seems misplaced  especially since an attempt
to appraise might have led to interesting results  For
 instance  some of the novels appear to be structurally
diffuse  Is this a defect  or are the authors working out of 
or trying to forge  a different kind of aesthetic  In
addition  the style of some Black novels  like Jean
Toomer s Cane  verges on expressionism or surrealism 
 does this technique provide a counterpoint to the
prevalent theme that portrays the fate against which Black
heroes are pitted  a theme usually conveyed by more
naturalistic modes of expression 
In spite of such omissions  what Rosenblatt does
 include in his discussion makes for an astute and
worthwhile study  Black Fiction surveys a wide variety
of novels  bringing to our attention in the process some
fascinating and little known works like James Weldon
Johnson s Autobiography of an Ex Colored Man  Its
 argument is tightly constructed  and its forthright  lucid
style exemplifies levelheaded and penetrating criticism

Many theories have been formulated to explain the
role of grazers such as zooplankton in controlling the
amount of planktonic algae  phytoplankton  in lakes 
Line The first theories of such grazer control were merely

based on observations of negative correlations
between algal and zooplankton numbers  A low num 
ber of algal cells in the presence of a high number of
grazers suggested  but did not prove  that the grazers
had removed most of the algae  The converse obser 
 vation  of the absence of grazers in areas of high
phytoplankton concentration  led Hardy to propose
his principle of animal exclusion  which hypothe 
sized that phytoplankton produced a repellent that
excluded grazers from regions of high phytoplankton
 concentration  This was the first suggestion of algal
defenses against grazing 
Perhaps the fact that many of these first studies
considered only algae of a size that could be collected
in a net  net phytoplankton   a practice that over 
 looked the smaller phytoplankton  nannoplankton 
that we now know grazers are most likely to feed on 
led to a de emphasis of the role of grazers in subse 
quent research  Increasingly  as in the individual
studies of Lund  Round  and Reynolds  researchers
 began to stress the importance of environmental
factors such as temperature  light  and water move 
ments in controlling algal numbers  These environ 
mental factors were amenable to field monitoring and
to simulation in the laboratory  Grazing was believed
 to have some effect on algal numbers  especially after
phytoplankton growth rates declined at the end of
bloom periods  but grazing was considered a minor
component of models that predicted algal population
dynamics 

The potential magnitude of grazing pressure on
freshwater phytoplankton has only recently been
determined empirically  Studies by Hargrave and
Geen estimated natural community grazing rates by
measuring feeding rates of individual zooplankton
 species in the laboratory and then computing com 
munity grazing rates for field conditions using the
known population density of grazers  The high esti 
mates of grazing pressure postulated by these




researchers were not fully accepted  however  until the
grazing rates of zooplankton were determined directly
in the field  by means of new experimental techniques 
Using a specially prepared feeding chamber  Haney
was able to record zooplankton grazing rates in natural
field conditions  In the periods of peak zooplankton
abundance  that is  in the late spring and in the summer 
Haney recorded maximum daily community grazing
rates  for nutrient poor lakes and bog lakes  respectively 
of   percent and  percent of daily phytoplankton
production  Cladocerans had higher grazing rates than
copepods  usually accounting for  percent of the
community grazing rate  These rates varied seasonally 
reaching the lowest point in the winter and early spring 
Haney s thorough research provides convincing field
evidence that grazers can exert significant pressure on
phytoplankton population 
  words 
  It can be inferred from the passage that the first
theories of grazer control mentioned in the first
paragraph would have been more convincing if
researchers had been able to
 observe high phytoplankton numbers under
natural lake conditions
 discover negative correlations between
algae and zooplankton numbers from their
field research
 understand the central importance of
environmental factors in controlling the
growth rates of phytoplankton
 make verifiable correlations of cause and
effect between zooplankton and
phytoplankton numbers
 invent laboratory techniques that would
have allowed them to bypass their field
research concerning grazer control
  Which of the following  if true  would call into
question Hardy s principle of animal exclusion 
 Zooplankton are not the only organisms
that are affected by phytoplankton
repellents 
 Zooplankton exclusion is unrelated to
phytoplankton population density 
 Zooplankton population density is higher
during some parts of the year than during
others 
 Net phytoplankton are more likely to
exclude zooplankton than are
nannoplankton 
 Phytoplankton numbers can be strongly
affected by environmental factors    It can be inferred from the passage that one way
in which many of the early researchers on grazer
control could have improved their data would
have been to
 emphasize the effects of temperature  rather
than of light  on phytoplankton
 disregard nannoplankton in their analysis of
phytoplankton numbers
 collect phytoplankton of all sizes before
analyzing the extent of phytoplankton
concentration
 recognize that phytoplankton other than net
phytoplankton could be collected in a net
 understand the crucial significance of net
phytoplankton in the diet of zooplankton
For the following question  consider each of the   According to the passage  Hargrave and Geen

  The author would be likely to agree with
which of the following statements regarding
the pressure of grazers on phytoplankton
numbers

than in bog lakes 
C Grazing tends to exert about the same

pressure as does temperature

Some modern anthropologists hold that biological
evolution has shaped not only human morphology but
also human behavior  The role those anthropologists
Line ascribe to evolution is not of dictating the details of

human behavior but one of imposing constraints 
ways of feeling  thinking  and acting that come natu 
rally in archetypal situations in any culture  Our
frailties emotions and motives such as rage  fear 
greed  gluttony  joy  lust  love may be a very mixed
 assortment  but they share at least one immediate

thus they give us our sense of constraints 
Unhappily  some of those frailties our need for
ever increasing security among them are presently
 maladaptive  Yet beneath the overlay of cultural
detail  they  too  are said to be biological in direction 
and therefore as natural to us as are our appendixes 
We would need to comprehend thoroughly their

 guide us now  And we might then begin to resist their

  Which of the following most probably provides
an appropriate analogy from human morphol

distinction made in the passage in relation to
human behavior 
 The ability of most people to see all the
colors of the visible spectrum as against
most people s inability to name any but
the primary colors
 The ability of even the least fortunate
people to show compassion as against
people s inability to mask their feelings

 The psychological profile of those people
who are able to delay gratification as
against people s inability to control their

 The greater lung capacity of mountain
peoples that helps them live in oxygen poor
air as against people s inability to fly

  It can be inferred that in his discussion of
maladaptive frailties the author assumes that
 evolution does not favor the emergence of
adaptive characteristics over the emergence
of maladaptive ones
 any structure or behavior not positively
adaptive is regarded as transitory in
evolutionary theory
 maladaptive characteristics  once fixed 
make the emergence of other maladaptive
characteristics more likely

the depletion of available new land needed for further
expansion of the American farming system  Actually 
however  new lands were taken up for farming in the
United States throughout and beyond the nineteenth
century  The emphasis of the presumed disappearance of
 the American frontier obscured the great importance of
changes in the conditions and consequences of
international trade that occurred during the second half of
the nineteenth century  Huge tracts of land were being
settled and farmed in Argentina  Australia  Canada  and in
 the American West  and these areas were joined with one
another and with the countries of Europe into an
interdependent market system  Consequently  agrarian
depressions no longer were local or national in scope  and
they struck several nations whose internal frontiers had

discontent in America paralleled the almost uninterrupted

Flatfish  such as the flounder  are among the few
vertebrates that lack approximate bilateral symmetry
 symmetry in which structures to the left and right of the
Line body s midline are mirror images   Most striking among

the many asymmetries evident in an adult flatfish is eye
placement  before maturity one eye migrates  so that in
an adult flatfish both eyes are on the same side of the
head  While in most species with asymmetries virtually
all adults share the same asymmetry  members of the
 starry flounder species can be either left eyed  both eyes
on the left side of head  or right eyed  In the waters
between the United States and Japan  the starry flounder
populations vary from about  percent left eyed off the
United States West Coast  through about  percent
 left eyed halfway between the United States and Japan 
to nearly  percent left eyed off the Japanese coast 
Biologists call this kind of gradual variation over a
certain geographic rang a cline and interpret clines as
strong indications that the variation is adaptive  a
 response to environmental differences  For the starry
flounder this interpretation implies that a geometric
difference  between fish that are mirror images of one
another  is adaptive  that left eyedness in the Japanese
starry flounder has been selected for  which provokes a
 perplexing questions  what is the selective advantage in
having both eyes on one side rather than on the other 
The ease with which a fish can reverse the effect of
the sidedness of its eye asymmetry simply by turning
around has caused biologists to study internal anatomy 
 especially the optic nerves  for the answer  In all flatfish
the optic nerves cross  so that the right optic nerve is
joined to the brain s left side and vice versa  This
crossing introduces an asymmetry  as one optic nerve
must cross above or below the other  G  H  Parker
 reasoned that if  for example  a flatfish s left eye
migrated when the right optic nerve was on top  there
would be a twisting of nerves  which might be
mechanically disadvantageous  For starry flounders  then 
the left eyed variety would be selected against  since in a
 starry flounder the left optic nerve is uppermost 
The problem with the above explanation is that the
Japanese starry flounder population is almost exclusively
left eyed  and natural selection never promotes a purely
less advantageous variation  As other explanations
 proved equally untenable  biologists concluded that there
is no important adaptive difference between left 
eyedness and right eyedness  and that the two
characteristics are genetically associated with some
other adaptively significant characteristic  This
 situation is one commonly encountered by
evolutionary biologists  who must often decide
whether a characteristic is adaptive or selectively
neutral  As for the left eyed and right eyed flatfish 
their difference  however striking  appears to be an
 evolutionary red herring

In the early  s  historians who studied
preindustrial Europe  which we may define here as
Europe in the period from roughly  to   began 
Line for the first time in large numbers  to investigate more

of the preindustrial European population than the  or 
percent who comprised the political and social elite  the
kings  generals  judges  nobles  bishops  and local
magnates who had hitherto usually filled history books 
One difficulty  however  was that few of the remaining

 percent recorded their thoughts or had them
chronicled by contemporaries  Faced with this situation 
many historians based their investigations on the only
records that seemed to exist  birth  marriage  and death
records  As a result  much of the early work on the

nonelite was aridly statistical in nature  reducing the
vast majority of the population to a set of numbers was
hardly more enlightening than ignoring them altogether 
Historians still did not know what these people thought
or felt 

One way out of this dilemma was to turn to the
records of legal courts  for here the voices of the
nonelite can most often be heard  as witnesses  plaintiffs 
and defendants  These documents have acted as a point
of entry into the mental world of the poor  Historians

such as Le Roy Ladurie have used the documents to
extract case histories  which have illuminated the
attitudes of different social groups  these attitudes
include  but are not confined to  attitudes toward crime
and the law  and have revealed how the authorities

administered justice  It has been societies that have had
a developed police system and practiced Roman law 
with its written depositions  whose court records have
yielded the most data to historians  In Anglo Saxon
countries hardly any of these benefits obtain  but it has

still been possible to glean information from the study
of legal documents 
The extraction of case histories is not  however  the
only use to which court records may be put  Historians
who study preindustrial Europe have used the records to

establish a series of categories of crime and to quantify
indictments that were issued over a given number of
years  This use of the records does yield some
information about the nonelite  but this information
gives us little insight into the mental lives of the

nonelite  We also know that the number of indictments
in preindustrial Europe bears little relation to the
number of actual criminal acts  and we strongly suspect
that the relationship has varied widely over time  In
addition  aggregate population estimates are very
 shaky  which makes it difficult for historians to
compare rates of crime per thousand in one decade of
the preindustrial period with rates in another decade 
Given these inadequacies  it is clear why the case
history use of court records is to be preferred

Line a considerable and inevitable number of coincidences

with one or the other of them as far as subject matter and
positive enactment are concerned that its study is
indispensable in order to appreciate adequately the full
range of possible legal phenomena  Even the two other
representatives of sacred law that are historically and
 geographically nearest to it  Jewish law and Roman
Catholic canon law  are perceptibly different 
Both Jewish law and canon law are more uniform
than Islamic law  Though historically there is a
discernible break between Jewish law of the sovereign
 state of ancient Israel and of the Diaspora  the dispersion
of Jewish people after the conquest of Israel   the spirit of
the legal matter in later parts of the Old Testament is very
close to that of the Talmud  one of the primary
codifications of Jewish law in the Diaspora  Islam  on the
 other hand  represented a radical breakaway from the
Arab paganism that preceded it  Islamic law is the result
of an examination  from a religious angle  of legal subject
matter that was far from uniform  comprising as it did the
various components of the laws of pre Islamic Arabia and
 numerous legal elements taken over from the non Arab
peoples of the conquered territories  All this was unified
by being subjected to the same kind of religious scrutiny 
the impact of which varied greatly  being almost
nonexistent in some fields  and in others originating novel
 institutions  This central duality of legal subject matter
and religious norm is additional to the variety of legal 
ethical  and ritual rules that is typical of sacred law 
In its relation to the secular state  Islamic law
differed from both Jewish and canon law  Jewish law was
 buttressed by the cohesion of the community  reinforced
by pressure from outside  its rules are the direct
expression of this feeling of cohesion  tending toward the
accommodation of dissent  Canon and Islamic law  on the
contrary  were dominated by the dualism of religion and
 state  where the state was not  in contrast with Judaism 
an alien power but the political expression of the same
religion  But the conflict between state and religion took
different forms  in Christianity it appeared as the struggle
for political power on the part of a tightly organized
 ecclesiastical hierarchy  and canon law was one of its
political weapons  Islamic law  on the other hand  was
never supported by an organized institution  consequently 
there never developed an overt trial of strength  There
merely existed discordance between application of the
 sacred law and many of the regulations framed by
Islamic states  this antagonism varied according to place

Many critics of Eamily Bronte s novel Wuthering
Heights see its second part as a counterpoint that
comments on  if it does not reverse  the first part  where
a romantic reading receives more confirmation  Seeing
the two parts as a whole is encouraged by the novel s
sophisticated structure  revealed in its complex use of
narrators and time shifts  Granted that the presence of
these elements need not argue an authorial awareness of
novelistic construction comparable to that of Henry
James  their presence does encourage attempts to unify
the novel s heterogeneous parts  However  any
interpretation that seeks to unify all of the novel s
diverse elements is bound to be somewhat
unconvincing  This is not because such an
interpretation necessarily stiffens into a thesis  although
rigidity in any interpretation of this or of any novel is
always a danger   but because Wuthering Heights has
recalcitrant elements of undeniable power that 
ultimately  resist inclusion in an all encompassing
interpretation  In this respect  Wuthering Heights shares
a feature of Hamlet 
  words 
  Which of the following inferences about Henry
James s awareness of novelistic construction is
best supported by the passage 
 James  more than any other novelist  was
aware of the difficulties of novelistic
construction 
 James was very aware of the details of novel 
istic construction 
 James s awareness of novelistic construction
derived from his reading of Bronte 
 James s awareness of novelistic construction
has led most commentators to see unity in
his individual novels 
 James s awareness of novelistic construction
precluded him from violating the unity of
his novels 
  The author of the passage would be most likely to
agree that an interpretation of a novel should
 not try to unite heterogeneous elements in the
novel
 not be inflexible in its treatment of the elements
in the novel
 not argue that the complex use of narrators or
of time shifts indicates a sophisticated structure
 concentrate on those recalcitrant elements of
the novel that are outside the novel s main
structure
 primarily consider those elements of novelistic
construction of which the author of the novel
was aware
  According to the passage  which of the following is
a true statement about the first and second parts of
Wuthering Heights 
 The second part has received more attention
from critics 
 The second part has little relation to the first part 
 The second part annuls the force of the first part 
 The second part provides less substantiation
for a romantic reading 
The second part is better because it is more realistic 
For the following question  consider each of the
choices separately and select all that apply

The deep sea typically has a sparse fauna dominated
by tiny worms and crustaceans  with an even sparser
distribution of larger animals  However  near
Line hydrothermal vents  areas of the ocean where warm water

emerges from subterranean sources  live remarkable
densities of huge clams  blind crabs  and fish 
Most deep sea faunas rely for food on particulate
matter  ultimately derived from photosynthesis  falling
from above  The food supplies necessary to sustain the
 large vent communities  however  must be many times
the ordinary fallout  The first reports describing vent
faunas proposed two possible sources of nutrition 
bacterial chemosynthesis  production of food by bacteria
using energy derived from chemical changes  and
 advection  the drifting of food materials from surrounding
regions  Later  evidence in support of the idea of intense
local chemosynthesis was accumulated  hydrogen sulfide
was found in vent water  many vent site bacteria were
found to be capable of chemosynthesis  and extremely
 large concentrations of bacteria were found in samples of
vent water thought to be pure  This final observation
seemed decisive  If such astonishing concentrations of
bacteria were typical of vent outflow  then food within the
vent would dwarf any contribution from advection 
 Hence  the widely quoted conclusion was reached that
bacterial chemosynthesis provides the foundation for
hydrothermal vent food chains an exciting prospect
because no other communities on Earth are independent
of photosynthesis 

There are  however  certain difficulties with this
interpretation  For example  some of the large sedentary
organisms associated with vents are also found at
ordinary deep sea temperatures many meters from the
nearest hydrothermal sources  This suggests that bacterial
 chemosynthesis is not a sufficient source of nutrition for
these creatures  Another difficulty is that similarly dense
populations of large deep sea animals have been found in
the proximity of smokers vents where water emerges
at temperatures up to C  No bacteria can survive such
 heat  and no bacteria were found there  Unless smokers
are consistently located near more hospitable warm water
vents  chemosynthesis can account for only a fraction of
the vent faunas  It is conceivable  however  that these
large  sedentary organisms do in fact feed on bacteria that
 grow in warm water vents  rise in the vent water  and then
rain in peripheral areas to nourish animals living some
distance from the warm water vents 
Nonetheless  advection is a more likely alternative
food source  Research has demonstrated that advective
 flow  which originates near the surface of the ocean
where suspended particulate matter accumulates 
transports some of that matter and water to the vents 
Estimates suggest that for every cubic meter of vent
discharge   milligrams of particulate organic
 material would be advected into the vent area  Thus  for
an average sized vent  advection could provide more
than  kilograms of potential food per day  In addition 
it is likely that small live animals in the advected water
might be killed or stunned by thermal and/or chemical
 shock  thereby contributing to the food supply of vents

The determination of the sources of copper ore used in
the manufacture of copper and bronze artifacts of Bronze
Age civilizations would add greatly to our knowledge of
Line cultural contacts and trade in that era  Researchers have
 analyzed artifacts and ores for their concentrations of elements 
but for a variety of reasons  these studies have generally failed
to provide evidence of the sources of the copper used in the
objects  Elemental composition can vary within the same
copper ore lode  usually because of varying admixtures of
 other elements  especially iron  lead  zinc  and arsenic  And
high concentrations of cobalt or zinc  noticed in some artifacts 
appear in a variety of copper ore sources  Moreover  the
processing of ores introduced poorly controlled changes
in the concentrations of minor and trace elements in the
 resulting metal  Some elements evaporate during smelting
and roasting  different temperatures and processes produce
different degrees of loss  Finally  flux  which is sometimes
added during smelting to remove waste material from the
ore  could add quantities of elements to the final product 

An elemental property that is unchanged through these
chemical processes is the isotopic composition of each
metallic element in the ore  Isotopic composition  the
percentages of the different isotopes of an element in a given
sample of the element  is therefore particularly suitable as an
 indicator of the sources of the ore  Of course  for this purpose
it is necessary to find an element whose isotopic composition
is more or less constant throughout a given ore body  but
varies from one copper ore body to another or  at least  from
one geographic region to another 

The ideal choice  when isotopic composition is used to
investigate the source of copper ore  would seem to be copper
itself  It has been shown that small but measurable variations
occur naturally in the isotopic composition of copper 
However  the variations are large enough only in rare
 ores  between samples of the common ore minerals of copper 
isotopic variations greater than the measurement error have
not been found  An alternative choice is lead  which occurs
in most copper and bronze artifacts of the Bronze Age in
amounts consistent with the lead being derived from the
 copper ores and possibly from the fluxes  The isotopic
composition of lead often varies from one source of
common copper ore to another  with variations exceeding
the measurement error  and preliminary studies indicate
virtually uniform isotopic composition of the lead from a
 single copper ore source  While some of the lead found in
an artifact may have been introduced from flux or when
other metals were added to the copper ore  lead so added in
Bronze Age processing would usually have the same isotopic


composition as the lead in the copper ore  Lead isotope
studies may thus prove useful for interpreting the
archaeological record of the Bronze Age

smelting in the last sentence in the last paragraph in

  It can be inferred from the passage that the use
of flux in processing copper ore can alter the

EXCEPT when
 there is a smaller concentration of lead in
the flux than in the copper ore
 the concentration of lead in the flux is
equivalent to that of the lead in the ore
 some of the lead in the flux evaporates
during processing
 any lead in the flux has the same isotopic
composition as the lead in the ore
 other metals are added during processing

choices separately and select all that apply

through the use of what Webb calls garrison

legislative assembly but real authority  in Webb s view 
belonged to the colonial governor  who was appointed by
the king and supported by the garrison  that is  by the

legislative assemblies represented the interests not of the

that people with familial hypercholesterolemia appear to

wondered  could a genetic mutation that causes a slow down
in the removal of LDL s from the blood also result in an
increase in the synthesis of this cholesterol carrying protein 
Since scientists could not experiment on human body
tissue  their knowledge of familial hyper  cholesterolemia
was severely limited  However  a breakthrough came in the
laboratories of Yoshio Watanabe of Kobe University in Japan
in   Watanabe noticed that a male rabbit in his colony
had ten times the normal concentration of cholesterol in its
blood  By appropriate breeding  Watanabe obtained a strain
of rabbits that had very high cholesterol levels  These rabbits
spontaneously developed heart disease  To his surprise 
Watanabe further found that the rabbits  like humans with
familial hypercholesterolemia  lacked LDL receptors  Thus 
scientists could study these Watanabe rabbits to gain a better
understanding of familial hyper 
cholesterolemia in humans 
Prior to the breakthrough at Kobe University  it was
known that LDL s are secreted from the liver in the form of a
precursor  called very low density lipoproteins  VLDL s  
which carry triglycerides as well as relatively small amounts
of cholesterol  The triglycerides are removed from the
VLDL s by fatty and other tissues  What remains is a remnant
particle that must be removed from the blood  What scientists
learned by studying the Watanabe rabbits is that the removal
of the VLDL remnant requires the LDL receptor  Normally 
the majority of the VLDL remnants go to the liver where they
bind to LDL receptors and are degraded  In the Watanabe
rabbit  due to a lack of LDL receptors on liver cells  the
VLDL remnants remain in the blood and are eventually

However  a number of features that are characteristic

example  many wind pollinated species fail to release
pollen when wind speeds are low or when humid
conditions prevail  Recent studies suggest another way in
which species compensate for the inefficiency of wind
pollination  These studies suggest that species frequently

to produce a species specific pattern of pollen collision on

these surfaces are strategically located  the consequences
of this combination can significantly increase the

A critical question that remains to be answered is
whether the morphological attributes of the female
reproductive organs of wind pollinated species are
evolutionary adaptations to wind pollination or are merely
fortuitous  A complete resolution of the question is as yet
impossible since adaptation must be evaluated for each
species within its own unique functional context

evolutionary adaptations does exist in some species  one
must be careful about attributing morphology to

caterpillars  Because the number of eggs a female moth

produces is directly related to her size  and because her
size is determined entirely by her feeding success as a
caterpillar  the trees  defensive mechanism has an impact
on moth fecundity 
The gypsy moth is also subject to attack by the
nucleopolyhedrosis virus  or wilt disease  a particularly
important killer of the caterpillars in outbreak years 
Caterpillars contract wilt disease when they eat a leaf to
which the virus  encased in a protein globule  has become
attached  Once ingested by a caterpillar  the protein
globule dissolves  releasing thousands of viruses  or
virions  that after about two weeks multiply enough to fill
the entire body cavity  When the caterpillar dies  the
virions are released to the outside  encased in a new
protein globule synthesized from the caterpillar s tissues
and ready to be picked up by other caterpillars 
Knowing that phenols  including tannins  often act by
associating with and altering the activity of proteins 
researchers focused on the effects on caterpillars of
ingesting the virus and leaves together  They found that
on tannin rich oak leaves  the virus is considerably less
effective at killing caterpillars than when it is on aspen
leaves  which are lower in phenols  In general  the more
concentrated the phenols in tree leaves  the less deadly the
virus  Thus  while highly concentrated phenols in tree
leaves reduce the caterpillar population by limiting the size
of caterpillars and  consequently  the size of the female s
egg cluster  these same chemicals also help caterpillars
survive by disabling the wilt virus  Forest stands of red
oaks  with their tannin rich foliage  may even provide
caterpillars with safe havens from disease  In stands

The rate of any chemical reaction  regardless of the

very important characteristic known as its activation energy 
Any molecule can be imagined to reside at the bottom of a

corresponds to the transition of a molecule from the bottom
of one potential well to the bottom of another  In classical
chemistry  such a transition can be accomplished only by
going over the potential barrier between the wells  the
